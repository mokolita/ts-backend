# TROUBLESHOOT - A Free Camping CRUD App.

## Description:
This project is intended to let users add locations where camping is free and legal. In upcoming versions, Google Maps APIs will be used to allow users the ability to search on the map for their location or other locations they intend on exploring.

## Installation 
Use the github fork and clone: 
https://github.com/mokolita/ts-backend
https://github.com/mokolita/ts-frontend

Moving forward, as the Google Maps APIs get incorporated, the API token may be hidden. To get one, go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis and add that token to the header in the Application Controller or create your own .gitignore.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Documentation:
See the Google Maps documentation on how the APIs are integrated: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
